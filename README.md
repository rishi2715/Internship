# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment

# Start of Internship : 

# Week 1: Created a Home Page for the Event Management Website

## Outline of Week-1:
- Introduction to JavaScript and its features
- JavaScript syntax, output, operators, and data types
- JavaScript functions, strings, and string functions
- JavaScript math.random() function
- Created a captcha code using JavaScript

## üìù Day-by-Day Progress

### Day 1: Introduction to JavaScript and its Features
- **Learned about JavaScript:** Understood the role of JavaScript in web development, including its capabilities for adding interactivity to web pages.

### Day 2: JavaScript Syntax, Output, Operators, and Data Types
- **JavaScript Syntax:** Studied the basic syntax rules of JavaScript, including how to write and execute code.
- **Output Methods:** Explored different methods to produce output in JavaScript, such as `console.log()`, `alert()`, and `document.write()`.
- **Operators and Data Types:** Learned about various operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical) and data types (string, number, boolean, object) in JavaScript.

### Day 3: JavaScript Functions, Strings, and String Functions
- **Functions:** Created and invoked JavaScript functions to perform specific tasks. Understood the importance of functions for code reusability and organization.
- **Strings and String Functions:** Manipulated strings using JavaScript. Explored common string functions like `length`, `indexOf()`, `substring()`, `replace()`, and `toUpperCase()`.

### Day 4: JavaScript math.random() Function and Creating a Captcha Code
- **math.random() Function:** Used the `math.random()` function to generate random numbers, which is essential for creating dynamic and unpredictable content.
- **Captcha Code:** Implemented a simple captcha code using JavaScript. This included generating random numbers and characters and displaying them as a challenge for users to complete.

### Day 5: Finalizing the Home Page
- **Integrated JavaScript:** Incorporated the learned JavaScript functionalities into the home page of the Event Management website, making it interactive and user-friendly.
- **Testing and Debugging:** Tested the implemented JavaScript code to ensure everything works as expected. Debugged any issues that arose during testing.

## Technologies Explored
- **HTML5:** Structured the content and elements of the home page.
- **CSS3:** Styled the home page to improve its visual appeal and user experience.
- **JavaScript:** Added interactivity and dynamic features to the home page.
